### Note

To set up an automated email response system for customer support in Python, you'll need to use an email library like smtplib and email.mime to send and format the emails.This code establishes an SMTP connection to your email server, logs in, and sends an automated response to the customer's query. You need to replace 'your-smtp-server.com', 'your-email@example.com', 'your-email-password', 'customer@example.com', and [Your response here] with your actual email server details, email address, email password, customer's email, and the response message.
